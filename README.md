# hugbot

silly discord bot to hug your friends (or enemies, it doesn't care) through the power of the internet

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

this entire project is a terrible mess of embarassing code, please don't look at it or else i will cry

if you decide to, god forbid, contribute to this project, i am not responsible for any damage to your mental health that may occur in the process

## i want to use this on discord!!!

you can add the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1066656711995301928&permissions=1374456768576&scope=bot). if anything goes wrong or you have any questions or anything else to say, you can contact me on discord at `haley üëª#5308`.

beware that this bot is hosted on the computer equivalent of your grandma's toaster, so 100% uptime or responsiveness are not guaranteed.

## i want to host this on my own thing!!

first of all, why? second of all, you can do that by

1. cloning this repo
2. installing the dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. running `python3 setup.py` which will create all the necessary files for you (how sweet of it)
4. editing the folder path in `main.py` to the path you cloned the repo to (fyi that's line 10)
5. running `python3 main.py`
6. reconsidering your life choices that led you to this point
